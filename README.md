# Tone Wizzard!
The Tone Wizzard App is Every Musician's Favorite Companion

Remember when that genius lightning bolt of wicked sweet sounds struck your brain, and you just had to jot it down? Do you remember what happened right after you barely made it to the nearest recording device and/or utensils? Have you ever been working on a piece of music and got stumped on a particular chord progression? Have you ever hit a mid-session blank while harmonizing vocals?

If you, or anyone you know, can relate to any of the above questions and scenarios, then Tone Wizzard just might find it's way to your device! The initial version features a handy-dandy quick-picks of simple facts and characteristics of the core scales. In one click of a button you will have at your fingertips full scales, thirds, fifths, roots, and relative minor counterpart notes information! 

That is all for version 1.0, however, there are tons of potential upgrades already sounding off!
